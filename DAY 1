Program efficiency
E is all about time and space complexity
Dynamic programming
In greedy approach what ever sol given at the 1st goal is fixed as the final sol
Note: this is not the best approach for all the scenarious
How ever it also works some cases
In dp we will be finding out all the possible sols for the given problem out of which the best will be picked
Time and space complexity
Aymptotic notations
Bigo(n), theta, omega

For(int i=0;i<n;i++)
{
Statements;
}
If n=5
It executes n+1 times
For(i=1;i<n;i+2)
{
Statement;
}
n/2
f(n)=n/2
degree of polynomial is n
so n/2 anything is n
so here also O(n)
so irrespective of iteration time is gonna be the same O(n)


get one input and find the sum of digit of the input
